## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Hybrid Breast Cancer Predictor Tool** that combines the power of **Neural Networks (MLPClassifier)** with a **Rule-based Explainable AI system**.  

It predicts whether a tumor is **Malignant** or **Benign**, while also providing:  
- Detailed **parameter analysis** (normal, borderline, abnormal)  
- **Professional advice and clinical implications**  
- Auto-generated **PDF diagnostic reports** for patients  

⚡ This project demonstrates **Machine Learning, Explainable AI, Visualization, and Deployment skills** — making it a strong portfolio project for jobs & internships.
